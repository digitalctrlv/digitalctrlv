_This is a screenshot of a tiny HTML page I created using elements from a github library (https://github.com/jdan/98.css) and my custom css. It's supposed to represent a computer screen running on Windows 98 because... I like that aesthetic 😅 However, it is not yet entirely finished, so you'll have to enjoy the most recent update of 31-07!_
